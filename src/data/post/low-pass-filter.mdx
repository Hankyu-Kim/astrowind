### Introduction

This post introduces the **Low Pass Filter (LPF)** from a **control systems perspective**.

In electrical engineering, LPFs are commonly studied in signal processing or image processing courses.  
They are typically used to attenuate high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency components.

Rather than focusing on hardware implementations using R, L, and C components, this post explains LPF as a **software-based recursive filter**, building directly on moving average filters.

### Review: Limitation of the Moving Average Filter

The moving average filter improves upon the simple average by considering only a recent window of data.

However, it has a critical limitation:

> **All samples within the window are treated equally.**

Consider the sequence:

$$
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
$$

Assume a window size of $n=5$.

At time $k$, the window becomes:

$$
[2,3,4,5,6]
$$

The moving average assigns each value a weight of $1/5$.

But observe:
- 2 is 5 seconds old
- 3 is 4 seconds old
- 6 is the most recent measurement

Despite this, all samples contribute equally.

### Motivation for Low Pass Filtering

In real systems, **recent measurements are usually more informative** than older ones.

A natural question arises:

> What if we assign **more weight to newer data**?

For example, instead of computing

$$
\frac{2+3+4+5+6}{5} = 4
$$

we could emphasize the most recent value:

$$
\frac{2+3+4+5+1.5 \times 6}{5.5} \approx 4.18
$$

This produces an estimate that reacts faster to changes while still suppressing noise.

### Core Idea of the Low Pass Filter

A low pass filter can be interpreted as a **weighted moving average**, where newer samples receive higher importance.

In recursive form:

$$
x_k = (1-a)\,\bar{x}_{k-1} + a\,x_k
$$

where:
- $\bar{x}_{k-1}$ is the previous filtered value
- $x_k$ is the current measurement
- $a$ is a weighting factor with $0 < a < 1$

The parameter $a$ controls how strongly the filter reacts to new data.

### Comparison with Moving Average

- **Moving Average**  
  Equal weights for all samples in the window

- **Low Pass Filter**  
  Larger weight on recent samples  
  Smaller weight on older information

This difference becomes increasingly important when:
- The signal changes rapidly
- The window size is large
- Tracking accuracy matters

---

### Visual Comparison Insight

When tracking a signal such as:

$$
y = x + 1 + \text{noise}
$$

- Moving average exhibits noticeable lag
- Low pass filter follows the trend more closely

Even with a small number of samples, the improvement is visually apparent.

---

### Practical Recursive Update

In implementation, LPF often appears as:

$$
\bar{x}_k = \bar{x}_{k-1} + a \left( x_k - \bar{x}_{k-1} \right)
$$

This form highlights that:
- The filter corrects the previous estimate
- The correction magnitude depends on $a$

This structure is fundamental in control and estimation theory.

---

### Why This Matters

- LPF balances noise suppression and responsiveness
- It generalizes moving average filters
- It directly leads to Kalman filtering concepts

Choosing $a$ appropriately is critical:
- Small $a$ → smoother but slower response
- Large $a$ → faster response but more noise

---

### Summary

- Moving average filters treat all samples equally
- Low pass filters emphasize recent measurements
- LPF reduces lag while maintaining noise suppression
- LPF forms the conceptual bridge to Kalman filters

**Weighting recent information is the key to practical filtering.**
