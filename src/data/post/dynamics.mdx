### Definition
Dynamics is the branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of bodies under the influence of forces. 

### Sort
- Translational motion
- Rotational motion

Translational motion, which refers to movement along a straight line, and rotational motion, which refers to movement around an axis. Both play an essential role in understanding how physical systems behave, whether they are as simple as a sliding block or as complex as a rotating satellite.

At the foundation of translational dynamics lies Newton’s Second Law, which states that the force acting on a body equals its mass multiplied by its acceleration. This relationship, often expressed as *F = ma*, allows us to predict how an object will accelerate when subjected to external forces. Rotational dynamics follow a parallel principle: torque applied to a body equals its moment of inertia multiplied by its angular acceleration, written as *τ = Iα*. Here, the moment of inertia describes how mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation, determining how resistant the body is to changes in its rotational speed.

### Interpretation
1. Draw 'free body diagram' with all the external force.
2. Describe the differential equation(equation of motion) which describes the dynamics behaviour of the system.
3. Get the transfer function using Laplace transform.

When analyzing any dynamic system, the process typically begins by drawing a free body diagram to capture all the forces and torques acting on the system. From there, one can derive the governing equations of motion and apply Newton’s laws in either their translational or rotational form. To further analyze and control such systems, engineers often transform these equations into the frequency domain using tools like the Laplace Transform, ultimately obtaining a transfer function that links inputs and outputs.

### Inertia
One important concept in rotational dynamics is the moment of inertia. A body with mass located farther from its axis of rotation will have a larger moment of inertia, requiring greater torque to achieve the same angular acceleration. This principle explains why figure skaters spin faster when they pull their arms in—reducing their moment of inertia—and slower when they extend them outward.

### Recall) Angular velocity and angular acceleration
Angular motion introduces quantities such as angular velocity (the rate of change of angular displacement) and angular acceleration (the rate of change of angular velocity). For example, a wheel rolling on the ground illustrates the link between linear and angular measures. The linear velocity and acceleration of a point on the rim of the wheel are proportional to its radius multiplied by angular velocity and angular acceleration, respectively (*v = rω*, *a = rα*). This relationship provides the bridge between rotational and translational motion in practical systems.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, dynamics serves as a cornerstone of system modeling, allowing us to predict and control how real-world objects move and interact with their environment. By carefully considering forces, torques, and inertial properties, engineers and scientists can design systems that behave predictably, whether in robotics, automotive design, aerospace engineering, or countless other applications.
