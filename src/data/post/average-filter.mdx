### Introduction

This post introduces the **Average Filter**, one of the simplest yet most powerful tools in signal processing and estimation.

Although the idea of taking an average is trivial, expressing it as a **recursive filter** reveals a structure that appears throughout modern estimation theory, including the Kalman filter.

---

### One-Sentence Definition

- **Average Filter**  
  > An average filter updates an estimate by combining the previous average with the current measurement.

---

### Basic Definition of an Average

Given $N$ samples, the arithmetic mean is defined as

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i
$$

For example,

$$
[1,2,3,4,5] \;\rightarrow\; \frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5} = 3
$$

This is the most familiar form of averaging.

---

### Recursive Interpretation

Assume that the average of the first $k-1$ samples is already known:

$$
\bar{x}_{k-1} = \frac{1}{k-1} \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i
$$

When a new sample $x_k$ arrives, the updated average can be written as

$$
\bar{x}_k
= \frac{k-1}{k}\,\bar{x}_{k-1} + \frac{1}{k}\,x_k
$$

This can be rewritten in a generic form:

$$
\bar{x}_k = (1-a)\,\bar{x}_{k-1} + a\,x_k
$$

where

$$
a = \frac{1}{k}
$$

### Key Insight

- The average is updated incrementally
- Past information is not discarded
- The structure is inherently **recursive**

This recursive form is far more useful in real-time systems than recomputing the full sum at every step.

### Example: Noisy Voltage Measurement

Consider a car battery with a true voltage of approximately **14V**.

Due to sensor noise, the measured voltage fluctuates between **10V and 18V**.

Assume:
- Sampling interval: 1 second
- Total duration: 100 seconds

Applying an average filter:

- Early estimates fluctuate significantly
- As more samples accumulate, the estimate stabilizes
- The filtered voltage converges toward **14V**

Despite its simplicity, the average filter effectively suppresses noise.

### General Average Filter Equation

The average filter can be expressed as

$$
\bar{x}_k = (1-a)\,\bar{x}_{k-1} + a\,x_k
$$

where:
- $\bar{x}_k$ is the current estimate
- $\bar{x}_{k-1}$ is the previous estimate
- $x_k$ is the current measurement
- $a$ is the weighting factor

This structure directly appears in:
- Exponential moving averages
- Low-pass filters
- Kalman filters

---

### Why This Matters

- The average filter is the simplest recursive estimator
- All practical filters rely on recursion
- Understanding this structure is essential before studying Kalman filters

If the recursive nature of the average filter is not clear, advanced estimation methods will remain opaque.

### Summary

- The average filter is simple but fundamental
- It combines past estimates with new measurements
- It provides effective noise reduction
- It forms the conceptual foundation of modern estimation theory

**Simple mathematics, powerful implications.**
