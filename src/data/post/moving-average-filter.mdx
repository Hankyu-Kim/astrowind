### Introduction

This post introduces the **Moving Average Filter**, an extension of the basic average filter designed to handle **time-varying signals**.

As shown in the previous post, taking an average is highly effective at removing noise.  
However, when the underlying signal changes over time, a simple average filter becomes inadequate.

---

### Limitation of the Average Filter

The standard average filter computes the mean of **all past measurements**.

This works well when the true value is constant, but fails when the signal evolves.

Consider a signal that increases linearly:

$$
x_k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots
$$

Applying a cumulative average produces:

$$
1 \rightarrow 1.5 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 2.5 \rightarrow 3
$$

Instead of following the signal, the filter outputs a **smoothed but lagging estimate**.

As the sequence grows longer, this accumulated lag becomes more severe.

---

### Why Moving Average?

Most real-world signals are **dynamic**.

We want a filter that:
- Suppresses noise
- Responds to recent changes
- Does not accumulate long-term bias

This motivation leads to the **Moving Average Filter**.

---

### Core Idea

Instead of averaging *all* past data, the moving average computes the mean over a **fixed window of recent samples**.

At time $k$, only the most recent $n$ samples are used:

$$
\bar{x}_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=k-n+1}^{k} x_i
$$

Old data is discarded, allowing the estimate to track changes in the signal.

---

### Simple Example

Assume the input sequence:

$$
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
$$

Using a window size of $n=2$:

$$
1 \rightarrow 1.5 \rightarrow 2.5 \rightarrow 3.5 \rightarrow 4.5
$$

Comparison:

| Measured | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---------|---|---|---|---|---|
| Average Filter | 1 | 1.5 | 2 | 2.5 | 3 |
| Moving Average | 1 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3.5 | 4.5 |

Even in this simple case, the moving average tracks the signal far more accurately.

### Dynamic Signal Example

Consider a signal defined as

$$
y = x + 1 + \text{noise}
$$

- The average filter increasingly lags behind the true signal

![Super wide](~/assets/images/moving-average-filter2.png)

- The moving average filter continues to track the trend

Using a window of the most recent **5 samples**, the moving average maintains stability while responding to changes.

The performance difference becomes more pronounced as:
- The signal duration increases
- The signal variation becomes larger

---

### Efficient Recursive Update

The moving average can be updated efficiently without recomputing the full sum.

Let:
- $\bar{x}_{k-1}$ be the previous moving average
- $x_k$ be the new sample
- $x_{k-n}$ be the oldest sample leaving the window

Then:

$$
\bar{x}_k = \bar{x}_{k-1} + \frac{x_k - x_{k-n}}{n}
$$

This update rule highlights the **sliding window** nature of the filter.

---

### Key Insight

- Only the newest and oldest samples affect the update
- Middle samples remain unchanged
- The filter adapts quickly to signal changes

This structure provides a balance between **noise reduction** and **responsiveness**.

---

### Why This Matters

- Average filters fail for time-varying signals
- Moving average filters preserve dynamics
- Window size controls the noise–responsiveness tradeoff

The moving average filter is a practical stepping stone toward more advanced adaptive filters.

---

### Summary

- Moving average filters use a fixed window of recent data
- They remove noise without excessive lag
- They outperform cumulative averages on dynamic signals
- They are widely used in signal processing and control

**Simple modification, significantly better behavior.**
