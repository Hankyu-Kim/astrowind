### Introduction

In control and robotics, systems are commonly described using a **state-space model**:

$$
\dot{x} = A x + B u, \qquad y = C x
$$

Here,

- $x$ represents the internal **state**  
- $u$ is the **control input**  
- $y$ is the **measured output**

Two fundamental questions immediately arise:

1. Can we **infer the internal state** from what we measure?
2. Can we **drive the system** to desired states using control inputs?

These questions are formalized by the concepts of **observability** and **controllability**.

### One-Sentence Definitions

- **Observability**  
  > A system is observable if the output $y(t)$, measured over a finite time interval, uniquely determines the initial state $x(0)$.

- **Controllability**  
  > A system is controllable if an appropriate choice of input $u(t)$ can drive the state $x(t)$ from any initial state to any desired final state.

Although simple to state, these properties have deep implications for estimation and control.

### Observability: Can We See the State?

At first glance, the output equation

$$
y = Cx
$$

might suggest that observability depends only on $C$.  
However, this is **not sufficient**.

Observability is a property of the **pair $(A, C)$**, not just $C$.

#### Key intuition

- The output at a single instant is only a snapshot.
- Observability depends on how the **state evolves over time** through $A$, and whether hidden components eventually influence the output.

#### Example

Let

$$
x = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
C =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- The sensor directly measures only $x_1$.
- The dynamics cause $x_2$ to influence $x_1$ over time.

Although $x_2$ is not directly measured, it leaves a **trace in the output trajectory**, making the system observable.

If $A$ were zero, $x_2$ would never affect the output, and the system would be unobservable.

---

### Controllability: Can We Drive the State?

Similarly, controllability is not determined by the presence of $B$ alone.

It is a property of the **pair $(A, B)$**.

#### Key intuition

- $B$ determines where control input enters the system.
- $A$ determines how that influence propagates through the state.

A system is controllable if control inputs can reach **all state directions**, possibly indirectly through the dynamics.

#### Example

Consider

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
B =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- The input directly affects $x_2$.
- Through the dynamics, changes in $x_2$ propagate to $x_1$.

Even though $x_1$ is not directly actuated, it remains controllable via $x_2$.

If a state neither receives input nor is dynamically coupled to an actuated state, it becomes uncontrollable.

### Matrix-Based Tests (Practical Criteria)

To conveniently determine these properties, linear systems use rank-based tests.

#### Observability Matrix

$$
\mathcal{O} =
\begin{bmatrix}
C \\
CA \\
CA^2 \\
\vdots \\
CA^{n-1}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The system is observable if

$$
\mathrm{rank}(\mathcal{O}) = n
$$

This matrix collects all ways the state can influence the output over time.

---

#### Controllability Matrix

$$
\mathcal{C} =
\begin{bmatrix}
B & AB & A^2 B & \cdots & A^{n-1} B
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The system is controllable if

$$
\mathrm{rank}(\mathcal{C}) = n
$$

This matrix represents all state directions reachable by propagating the input through the dynamics.

---

### Why These Concepts Matter

- **Observability** is a prerequisite for state estimation methods such as the **Kalman filter**.
- **Controllability** is required to design stabilizing controllers such as **LQR**.
- In practice, weaker notions like **detectability** and **stabilizability** are often sufficient, ensuring that unstable modes are at least observable or controllable.

---

### Summary

- Observability answers: *Can we reconstruct the state from outputs over time?*
- Controllability answers: *Can we drive the state using inputs?*
- Both depend on system dynamics, not just sensors or actuators.
- Rank conditions provide a convenient and rigorous test.

Together, observability and controllability form the **structural backbone** of modern estimation and control theory, especially in robotics and autonomous driving.
